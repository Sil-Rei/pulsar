# pulsar-stocks
This is my demo project built with an Angular front-end and a Django REST API. 
The project simulates a stock portfolio website where users can create and manage multiple portfolios, simulating the performance of different stocks on a specific buy date (e.g. 12/02/2019). Additionally, users can share their portfolios on a community page and receive votes from others. 

The main features demonstrated in this project include a login and registration process, data communication between the front-end and back-end, a notification system, and a community page with a voting system.
